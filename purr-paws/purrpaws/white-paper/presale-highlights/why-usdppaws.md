1\.     **No Developer/Team Tokens**: In a bid to prioritize the community, $PPAWS ensures that no tokens are allocated to the development or team members. This approach fosters a truly decentralized environment, where every participant is on equal footing, and the projectâ€™s success relies solely on community-driven growth.

2\.     **No Private Sale**: $PPAWS values fairness and inclusivity. There is no private sale for early investors or special groups, ensuring that every participant has the same opportunity to get involved. The goal is to prevent any unfair advantage and to keep the project fully open to the public from the start.

3\.     **Low Fees on BSC**: Operating on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), $PPAWS benefits from fast and cost-effective transactions. By keeping transaction fees low, we ensure that investors can trade with minimal cost, maximizing their investment potential without being burdened by high transaction fees.

4\.     **Low Tax: 5% on Buy | 5% on Sell**: To promote a healthy and sustainable liquidity pool, $PPAWS applies a modest 5% tax on both buy and sell transactions. These taxes help fuel liquidity, ensure price stability, and reward the community, supporting the overall growth of the project.

5\.     **1-Year Liquidity Lock**: For added security and trust, 100% of the liquidity raised during the presale will be locked for a full year. This one-year liquidity lock provides stability for the community, preventing any sudden price fluctuations or rug-pull scenarios, which assures investors that the project is committed to long-term growth.

6\.     **Fair Launch Whitelisted**: $PPAWS is offering a whitelist for its fair launch, ensuring that those who are genuinely interested in the project have a chance to participate. This approach guarantees that all interested parties can secure their spot in the most anticipated token launch of 2025 on an equal footing.

7\.     **Soft Cap: 100 BNB**: The presale for $PPAWS has set a soft cap at 100 BNB, ensuring that there is a clear minimum threshold to move forward with the launch. This helps the team gauge the level of interest and ensure that the project can move forward with adequate funding and community support.

8\.     **Affiliate Reward: 10%**: $PPAWS offers one of the highest affiliate reward rates in the industry, with a generous 10% reward for every successful referral. This incentivizes the community to actively promote the token, helping to expand its reach and grow the user base through organic word-of-mouth.

9\.     **Bonus Buy: 10%**: For the first 25 whitelisted buyers who purchase a minimum of 2 BNB, $PPAWS offers an exclusive 10% bonus on their token purchase. This bonus serves as an extra incentive for early participants and rewards those who commit early to the project.

10\.  **CEX Listing Plans**: $PPAWS has ambitious plans to secure listings on top-tier centralized exchanges (CEXs). These listings will improve the accessibility of $PPAWS for a broader audience, increasing liquidity and providing more opportunities for trading across a variety of platforms.

11\.  **CG/CMC Fast Track**: In a bid to increase visibility and recognition, $PPAWS is on track for fast-tracking listings on CoinGecko (CG) and CoinMarketCap (CMC). This will provide quicker access to essential data and charts, boosting the projectâ€™s credibility and making it easier for potential investors to find important information.

12\.  **Aggressive Marketing Strategy**: $PPAWS has an aggressive marketing campaign in place to drive awareness, engagement, and adoption. With strategic partnerships, influencer collaborations, and community-driven events, the marketing strategy aims to ensure that the project garners the attention it deserves within the cryptocurrency space.

13\.  **30% Buyback & Burn System**: One of the standout features of $PPAWS is the 30% buyback and burn system. 30% of the funds raised will be used to buy back and burn $PPAWS tokens, helping to reduce the circulating supply and increase scarcity. This deflationary strategy will ultimately support long-term value growth by driving up demand as supply diminishes.

14\.  **The Ultimate Low Market Cap GEM**: $PPAWS presents an exceptional opportunity for early investors, with a focus on maintaining a low market cap. This strategy ensures that there is significant upside potential for those who invest early, positioning $PPAWS as one of the most promising low-cap gems in the crypto market.

15\.  **24/7 Support Chat**: Customer support is a top priority for $PPAWS. With a dedicated 24/7 support chat, users can get immediate assistance, whether itâ€™s for questions, issues, or general inquiries. This ensures a seamless experience for everyone involved in the project and reinforces the community-first ethos of $PPAWS.

16\.  **Based & Transparent Team**: Transparency and integrity are at the core of $PPAWS. The team behind the project is fully committed to providing regular updates, clear communication, and an open approach to project management. Investors can trust that the project is built on a foundation of honesty and openness, ensuring that everyone is always kept in the loop.
