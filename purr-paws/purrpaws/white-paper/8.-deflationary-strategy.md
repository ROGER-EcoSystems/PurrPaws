# 8. Deflationary Strategy

PurrPaws is a deflationary token project. Its supply decreases over time, driving up scarcity and supporting long-term price growth.

* Buyback & Burn Program: 10% of revenue from advertisements in PurrPaws Combat will be allocated to regularly buying back and burning $PPAWS tokens, reducing supply.

Tokenomics: Airdrops and community rewards distribute tokens, while the burn mechanism ensures that the circulating supply continues to shrink, benefiting long-term holders
