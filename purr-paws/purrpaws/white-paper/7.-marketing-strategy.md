# 7. Marketing Strategy

A strong marketing strategy is critical to PurrPaws’ success. The project’s marketing approach combines traditional techniques with modern digital tactics, designed to drive visibility, engagement, and adoption. The core elements of the marketing strategy include:

* Viral Content: Capitalizing on meme culture, we will create and distribute viral content across social media platforms, utilizing engaging visuals, memes, and videos to capture the community’s attention.
* Influencer Partnerships: Collaborating with influencers in the crypto and meme space will amplify the project’s reach and build credibility among potential investors.
* Community Engagement: Continuous interaction with the community through social media platforms (Telegram, Twitter, Discord, etc.) will foster loyalty and excitement. We will host regular AMAs, giveaways, and airdrops to incentivize participation.
* PawsCombat Integration: Our PawsCombat mini-game will serve as a revenue generation and community engagement tool, attracting players to interact with the token while also enabling them to earn.
* Cross-Promotion with RogerPad: Leveraging the RogerPad network, we will gain access to additional channels, including other projects launching through the platform, increasing exposure to a wider audience.
