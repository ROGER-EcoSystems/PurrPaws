# 11. Security and Compliance

Security and transparency are foundational to PurrPaws. The project undergoes rigorous third-party audits and KYC verification for all presale participants. Additionally, liquidity will be locked for 365 days post-launch to reinforce stability. Transparency is a priority, and all project information, from token issuance to transactions, will be accessible for verification.
