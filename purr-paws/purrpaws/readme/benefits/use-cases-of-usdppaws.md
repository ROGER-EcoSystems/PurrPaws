# Use Cases of $PPAWS



#### Engaging in PawsCombat Phases

$PPAWS serves as the primary currency within the PawsCombat game, enabling players to participate in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the gaming experience. Players can utilize $PPAWS to access various in-game features, enhancing their gameplay while also earning rewards denominated in $PPAWS. This integration encourages active participation and investment in the game, fostering a dynamic gaming environment.

#### Revenue Sharing through RogerNFT

Holders of RogerNFT can leverage their assets to earn a share of the advertising revenue generated by PawsCombat. This unique feature aligns the interests of NFT holders with the success of the PawsCombat platform, creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem. By holding RogerNFT, participants not only engage in the game but also benefit from its growing advertising income.

#### Buyback and Burn Mechanism

A portion of the advertising revenue from PawsCombat will be allocated to a Buyback and Burn program for $PPAWS. This strategic initiative aims to enhance the token's value by systematically purchasing $PPAWS from the market and permanently removing them from circulation. This deflationary model helps to stabilize the token's price and increases scarcity, ultimately benefiting the community of $PPAWS holders.
