# PreSale Highlights

1\. No Dev Tokens

PurrPaws allocates no tokens specifically to the development team, ensuring that the project is driven entirely by community interest and market demand. This alignment of developer incentives with the project’s long-term success eliminates potential sell pressure, promoting a healthier and more sustainable token economy.

2\. Low Tax of 5% on Buy and Sell Transactions

Our project features a minimal transaction tax of only 5% on both buy and sell orders, making it highly accessible to investors. This low tax structure encourages trading activity, contributing to liquidity while allowing investors to enter and exit positions without excessive costs. This also incentivizes long-term holding and trading, fostering a vibrant and active market.

3\. Low Hard Cap of 40 ETH

With a hard cap set at only 40 ETH, PurrPaws promotes exclusivity and early entry for investors while maintaining manageable fundraising limits. This approach leads to a more efficient distribution of tokens, enabling a focused and scalable growth strategy.

4\. Liquidity Pool (LP) Locked for 365 Days

To enhance stability and security, the liquidity pool is locked for 365 days. This lockup guarantees that liquidity remains available long-term, protecting investors from potential volatility or sudden withdrawals. The LP lock also underscores the team’s commitment to sustaining the project’s growth and market presence.

5\. Buyback and Burn Mechanism

Our innovative Buyback and Burn system, launched by RogerPad, is designed to strengthen and protect the PurrPaws ecosystem. Under this system, 25% of funds are allocated to the liquidity pool, while 26% is dedicated to buybacks and burns. This automated approach ensures stability and safeguards the project from potential jeeting activities, enhancing value for our community.

6\. CEX Listings for Increased Accessibility

PurrPaws is actively pursuing Centralized Exchange (CEX) listings to increase token accessibility and liquidity. By securing listings on reputable exchanges, we aim to attract a larger pool of investors, providing better trading opportunities and heightened market exposure.

7\. CMC/CG Fast Track

Maximizing exposure is essential for growth, and securing listings on major platforms is key. PurrPaws prioritizes listings on platforms such as CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko, ensuring critical visibility and accessibility for investors. We will swiftly secure our presence on these platforms to reach a broader audience.

8\. Aggressive Marketing Strategy with PawsCombat

9\. Fair and Transparent Tokenomics
