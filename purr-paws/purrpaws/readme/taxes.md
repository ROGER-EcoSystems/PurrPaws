# Taxes

To ensure long-term success and stability, our project will implement a transaction tax structure to support key areas: liquidity, marketing, and development. A total **buy and sell tax of 5%** will be applied, allocated as follows:

* **Liquidity Pool (2%)**: This portion will go directly into our liquidity pool, reinforcing the project's stability and ensuring a robust market for participants.
* **Marketing, Research, and Development (3%)**: The remaining 3% will fund our ongoing marketing efforts, strategic research, and product development, driving growth and innovation.

By strategically utilizing this tax structure, we aim to establish a sustainable ecosystem and deliver continued value to our community.
