# How to Level Up

There are multiple ways to quickly level up in PawsCombat.

Starting with a referral link grants you 5,000 bones, while your referrer earns up to 25,000 bones. Additionally, there are 350,000 bones available in the “Earn” section, located at the bottom of the interface, through various tasks. These initial points provide a strong head start, allowing you to reach level 4 with ease.

Once the game begins, strategic play can enhance your progress. Use the minting feature to increase your hourly auto-tap rate, or allocate bones to boost your energy and refill rewards. Remember, you have 6 refills per day, and auto-tap remains active for 3 hours after your last tap.

Lastly, inviting friends and family to join is an excellent way to advance. New players receive an airdrop, and you get an instant bonus reward for each referral. Plus, as they level up, you’ll benefit too!
